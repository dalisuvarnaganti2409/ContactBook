A Contact Book is a simple application that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve contact information such as a person’s name, phone number, and email address.

This project is implemented in C++ using a self-referential structure (linked list) to dynamically store contacts in memory, and also supports file storage for persistence so that data is saved even after closing the program.

✨ Features:

Add Contact – Insert new contacts with name, phone number, and email.

Sorted Insertion – Contacts are automatically stored in alphabetical order.

Display Contacts – View all saved contacts in a clean, tabular format.

Search Contact – Search by name to quickly find details.

Delete Contact – Remove any existing contact.

File Handling – Contacts are saved to and loaded from a text file.
